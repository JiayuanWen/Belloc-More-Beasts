        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>We as a group learned many things while working on this project More Beast(For Worse Children) By: Hilaire Belloc. Hilaire Belloc was known for his prose yet witty with clarity style of writing. We learned from a coding aspect how to identify patterns within the poems and pull interesting information from them as well. We were able to do that by using our knowledge and skills of XML to mark them up with what we found to be interesting, then using Xpath to decipher them all to see what patterns we came up with and then by using XSLT to turn that information into HTML to display for everyone to see.</p>
