The Python
The Python
A Python I should not advise,—
It needs a doctor for its eyes,
And has the measles yearly.
[212]
Subject it to music
However, if you feel inclined
To get one (to improve your mind,
And not from fashion merely),
[213]Allow no music near its cage;
Flies into a rage
And when it flies into a rage
Chastise it, most severely.
An aunt in Yucatan
[214]

I had an aunt in Yucatan
Who bought a Python from a man
And kept it for a pet.
She died, because she never knew
These simple little rules and few;—
[215]
The snake
The Snake is living yet.
