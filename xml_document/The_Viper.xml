The Viper
The Viper
Yet another great truth I record in my verse,
That some Vipers are venomous, some the reverse;
A fact you may prove if you try,
[235]
Procuring two vipers
By procuring two Vipers, and letting them bite;
[236]
A fright
With the first you are only the worse for a fright,
[237]
After the second
But after the second you die.
[238]
