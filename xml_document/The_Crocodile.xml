The Crocodile
The Crocodile
Whatever our faults, we can always engage
That no fancy or fable shall sully our page,
So take note of what follows, I beg.
This creature so grand and august in its age,
In its youth is hatched out of an egg.
[222]
The Missionary 1
And oft in some far Coptic town
The Missionary sits him down
To breakfast by the Nile:
The heart beneath his priestly gown
Is innocent of guile;
[223]
The Missionary 2
When suddenly the rigid frown
Of Panic is observed to drown
His customary smile.
Why does he leap
[224]

Why does he start and leap amain,
[225]
Scour the sandy Libyan plain
And scour the sandy Libyan plain
[226]
Like one who wants to catch a train
Like one that wants to catch a train,
[227]
Or wrestles with internal pain
Or wrestles with internal pain?
[228]
Egg-cup
Because he finds his egg contain—
Green, hungry, horrible and plain—
An Infant Crocodile.
[229]
